1. What are the two scenarios in which you can use PLINQ to speed up operations? Why does using PLINQ in these scenarios speed up processing?

when you need to iterrate through a collection to retrieve elements from the collection. they can be sped up because they are processed by a seperate thread
I/o bound issue
cpu bound issues

2. How doesAsParallel qualify as an extension method? First, explain what an extension method is and how you definene entension methods, and them explain why AsParallel qualifies as an extension method.

Extension methods enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type.


3. How do you cancel a PLINQ query before it finishes? Be specific with respect to the variables and methods used for the cancellation operation, and how the variables abd methods are used.

You specify a CancellationToken object from a CancellationTokenSource and use
the WithCancellation extension method of the ParallelQuery.

4. Why is it important to synchronize concurrent access to a server? Give an example of a specific condition that will cause an error in your application if concurrent access is not synchronized.

because you dont want data worked at the same time

5. What does the lock statement do?



6. This is not in the book. Define mutex, define semaphore, and explain the difference between them.



7. What does it mean to say that some collection classes are not thread safe? Explain how not being thread safe may lead one of these collection classes to produce a malfunction in the program.

they can be tampered with simultaneously because there are no locks

8. Explain how thread safe collection classes are made thread safe.



9. Why are thread safe classes slower than non-thread safe classes? Be specific.

becuase its all sequential and can't be accesssed parallel. they are locked
